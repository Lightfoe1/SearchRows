# SearchRows
Creates a table that has primary and secondary rows.
The primary rows are districts and the secondary rows are neighborhoods belonging to that district.

The search bar works like this: 
- If the name of the primary row is a hit display all of its child secondary rows.
- If the primary row is a no-hit but any of its secondary rows is a hit, display those secondary rows.

The project is a ASP.NET Core Web App(5.0).
